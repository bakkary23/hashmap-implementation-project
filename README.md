# hashmap-implementation-project
Portfolio Project of Data Structures course - implementations of a HashMap data structure

hashmap-oa implements a hash map data structure using open addressing. The main
HashMap class contains functions to put and remove a key/value pair in the map, clear the map, return the
load capacity, and return the number of empty buckets. It also contains functions for resizing the map,
and returning the key/values in a DynamicArray object. Functions for returning the value from a key,
returning the DynamicArray object the map is based on, and checking whether a key is contained in the
hashmap are also included.

hashmap-sc implements a hash map data structure using separate chaining. The main
HashMap class contains functions to put and remove a key/value pair in the map, clear the map, return the
load capacity, and return the number of empty buckets. It also contains functions for resizing the map,
and returning the key/values in a DynamicArray object. Functions for returning the value from a key,
returning the DynamicArray object the map is based on, and checking whether a key is contained in the
hashmap are also included. Finally, a separate function for finding the mode in a DynamicArray object using
this HashMap class is included.

a6-include contains data structures objects used for the above implementations, namely a dynamic array for the open address
implementation and nodes/linked list objects for separate chaining implementation.
